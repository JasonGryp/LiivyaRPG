### Rule out the Wicked
Through the power of her statistics skill, Liiv can successfully identify false claims in academic work and day to day conversations, and smite the liars with a trusty wooden ruler.

### Pre-de-doxification
%%
Get it, Prestidigitation? XD

Well set boundaries and good self insight help Liiv not to dox herself and oftentimes prevent others from doing the same.

### Sixth Sense
Feline arcanum brings about Liiv unhuman abilities. For extended periods of time she gains the ability to reply to every message, greet every chatter, welcome every raid, and shout out every fellow content creator. It's a sight to behold, and a frightening one at that.
